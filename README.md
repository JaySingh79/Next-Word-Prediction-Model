# Next-Word-Prediction-Model
The Next Word Prediction model, developed using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, predicts the next word in a sequence.  It employs data engineering techniques like tokenization, padding, and one-hot encoding for NLP tasks. The model comprises Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers, capturing patterns in sequential data for language generation.
